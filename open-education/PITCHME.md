another binary...or two

Note:
We have spoken in class about the existence of binaries, like the master-slave dialectic, oppressor/oppressed, student/teacher, and others. This paper will highlight at least two more binaries, or at least apparent binaries, and then discuss briefly how we might begin to think beyond those binaries and in a more holistic manner.

marginal voices are silenced

| Indigenous education | Online Education |
| :--- | ---:|
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities  |
| highly contextual   | very low context  |
| experiential, holistic, personal, orally transmitted, narrative, metaphor   | technologically mediated, therefore difficult to align w/ Indigenous education  |

aspirational narrative in Canada that 'open education' is a driver of social justice

massive inequality between Indigenous people and settlers

> The solution is not to integrate them (the oppressed) into the structure of oppression, but to transform that structure so that they become "beings for themselves". (Freire, 2018, p. 74)
