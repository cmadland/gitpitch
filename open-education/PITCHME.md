another binary...or two

Note:
We have spoken in class about the existence of binaries, like the master-slave dialectic, oppressor/oppressed, student/teacher, and others. This paper will highlight at least two more binaries, or at least apparent binaries, and then discuss briefly how we might begin to think beyond those binaries and in a more holistic manner.

digital technology *opens* and *closes*

'in' voices are algorithmically promoted

marginal voices are silenced

most educational technology is bullshit

| Indigenous education | Online Education |
| :--- | ---:|
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities  |
| highly contextual   | very low context  |
| experiential, holistic, personal, orally transmitted, narrative, metaphor   | technologically mediated, therefore difficult to align w/ Indigenous education  |

aspirational narrative in Canada that 'open education' is a driver of social justice

massive inequality between Indigenous people and settlers

mandate from the TRC

the solution *_is_* the problem

> The solution is not to integrate them (the oppressed) into the structure of oppression, but to transform that structure so that they become "beings for themselves". (Freire, 2018, p. 74)
