another binary...or two

Note:
We have spoken in class about the existence of binaries, like the master-slave dialectic, oppressor/oppressed, student/teacher, and others. This paper will highlight at least two more binaries, or at least apparent binaries, and then discuss briefly how we might begin to think beyond those binaries and in a more holistic manner.

Note:
I took this photograph on a trip to Norway in 2016 and it is an interesting historical location related to WWII and also can be used as a metaphor for education.

narrow and difficult

limited access

Note:
Notice three things:
- fjord
- steep cliffs
- tiny road along the left side

The pathway through the fjord is very narrow, exclusive to one side, and relatively inaccessible. There are several barriers to mobility.

Note:
This image, which I found online, but is licensed for reuse, is of the Rakaia River in New Zealand.
You should be able to notice that there are unlimited and constantly changing pathways through the riverbed. After each storm, or seasonal flood, there will be totally new pathways created. There are also myriad points of access. a person travelling through here could start at many different points and direct their own path through.

almost unlimited and constantly changing pathways

thousands of access points

Note:
These two images illustrate a binary with 'open' on one end and 'closed' on the other.

### 5 P's of Open Education

participation

pedagogy

permission

publishing

policy

Note:
I've been thinking about and researching the concept of open education this semester and have noticed that there are several, sometimes conflicting, views on what open education actually is. I've tentatively categorized these different views into 5 alliterative P-words.
---

# Participation

---

access for marginalized or remote groups

low barriers (format, technology, pre-requisites, cost)

networked & connected

agency

Note:
One of the most common rationales for open education is to increase access to higher education for marginalized or remote groups. Catherine Cronin describes it as an invitation to participate. It seems to me that this is an essential feature of OE. Without this commitment to increasing access to education, I think practitioners cease to be open. Openness is often enacted by lowering barriers like distance, finance, pre-requisites, time, and qualifications. Increasing student voice in the process of education by including students in relevant decisions about what will be learned, how it will be learned, and how it will be demonstrated is also important. "Nothing about me without me".
The remaining p-words can be seen as supporting and enhancing student participation.
---

# Pedagogy

---

agency

> participatory, student-directed projects (Paskevicius, 2017)

networked & connected

use and production of OER

Note:
The idea of open pedagogy, or open education practices, or OER-enabled pedagogies, is that there are learning activities that can be engaged which are afforded by the unique characteristics of open environments. By leveraging the permissions (next p) of open resources, faculty can engage their students with revising or remixing course materials and then redistributing them for future cohorts. These activities are presumed to increase the degree to which students are able to exercise their agency within a learning community.

---

# Permissions

---
### Creative Commons

reuse

revise

remix

redistribute

retain

(Wiley, ND)

Note:
The 5R permissions might be seen as catalysts for the processes of learning in open education environments. They don't seem to be necessary or sufficient, but they really do help. In North america, and particularly in BC, there has been a very pointed emphasis on the affordances of open licenses in reducing costs for students by making textbooks available free of charge.

# Publishing

# Awesome! Wow!

What about Indigenous students?

Do the 5Ps do *anything* to benefit Indigenous students?

'open' often requires digital technology

digital technology *opens* and *closes*

'in' voices are algorithmically promoted

marginal voices are silenced

(Funes & Mackness, 2018)

---

most educational technology is bullshit (Selwyn, 2016)

surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, 2015)

operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938)

| Indigenous education | Online Education |
| :--- | ---:|
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities  |
| highly contextual   | very low context  |
| experiential, holistic, personal, orally transmitted, narrative, metaphor   | technologically mediated, therefore difficult to align w/ Indigenous education  |

(Tessaro et al, 2017)

#### Learning is connected to land, culture, and spirit.

We—the two-legged, four-legged, finned and feathered, plants and rocks —are all related.
We must always practice reciprocity through acts of giving and receiving.

---

#### Learning honours our Ancestors, Elders, Knowledge Keepers and Descendents.

It respects and embraces ceremony, protocol, and teachings that are connected to the sacred medicines including tobacco, cedar, sage, and sweetgrass.
Important teachings emerge through stories.

---

#### Learning involves developing relationships, respecting distinct cultures, and honouring the perspective of others in our communities.

The deepest learning takes place through lived experience. It requires exploring our identities, learning from our mistakes, and having gratitude for our gifts.

---
#### Learning is a journey that takes courage, patience and humility.

It is about striving to become a better human being and living with balance in body, mind, heart and spirit.

aspirational narrative in Canada that 'open education' is a driver of social justice

the solution *_is_* the problem

> The solution is not to integrate them (the oppressed) into the structure of oppression, but to transform that structure so that they become "beings for themselves". (Freire, 2018, p. 74)

---

# 5 (more) R's

---

respect

reciprocity

relevance

responsibility

relationships

(Tessaro, et al, 2017)

---
### Respect

Note:
need to respect Indigenous cultures.
hierarchies aren't inherent to Indigenous worldviews...no separation between teacher and student
use Indigenous authors, allow for meaningful participant feedback, learning activities based in local community, opportunity to connect in real time

---

### Reciprocity

Note:
- countering decades of extractive and exploitative research
- learning is mutually beneficial
- listen to and respect student voice; horizontal sharing
- final assignment intended to stay in the school

---

### Relevance

Note:
- beyond book learning
- learning activities 'hands-on' in the community

---

### Responsibility

Note:
- responsible to culture
- responsive to personal responsibilities (family, work, etc)
- responsiblity to accreditors (gov't, bureaucracy)

---

### Relationships

Note:
- students and teachers
- students and students
- students and community

---
