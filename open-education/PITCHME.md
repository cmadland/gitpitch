digital technology opens and closes

| Indigenous education | Online Education |
| :--- | :---|
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities  |
| highly contextual   | very low context  |
| experiential, holistic, personal, orally transmitted, narrative, metaphor   | technologically mediated, therefore difficult to align w/ indigenous education  |


---
aspirational narrative around 'open education' in Canada as a driver of social justice
---
massive inequality between Indigenous people and settlers

mandate from the TRC
