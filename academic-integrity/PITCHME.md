> Tools are made by people, and most (or even all) educational technologies have pedagogies hard-coded into them in advance. This is why it is so essential we consider them carefully and critically—that we empty all our LEGOs onto the table and sift through them before we start building. Some tools are decidedly less innocuous than others. ([Jesse Stommel](https://www.slideshare.net/jessestommel/ethical-online-learning))

> Educators at every level must begin by listening to and trusting students. Teachers stand to learn more from students about online learning than we could ever teach. Many students come to an online or hybrid class knowing very well how to learn online, even if they don’t always know how to learn in an online course.

O’Mahony, D. C. (2018, June 29). Biggest waste of assessment practices in Higher Ed is that students work is provided to those that already know about the topic.

Stommel, J. (2018, June 21). Turnitin helps create and feed a culture of suspicion around students and their work. The company is invested in manufacturing a problem they can solve. They also monetize a database of student work, and those students are not compensated and have little to no ability to consent.https://twitter.com/maha9313/status/1009701001832607744 … [Tweet].

Stommel, J. (2018, June 23). Plagiarism exists. I’d never begrudge individual teachers for their frustrations at this. The work of teaching is hard. But why do entire institutions adopt and require the use of tools like Turnitin that assume from the start that students are dishonest, plagiarists, cheaters? [Tweet].
